# health-prompter
A powershell script for providing regular health prompts.

Every 30 minutes the script provides a notification telling the user to stretch their legs and rest their eyes. 

The script also polls the F15 key every minute which can be bound in other software. For example; a heart-rate monitoring piece of software synced with a smart-watch can be made to record a log entry on each poll, providing a minute-by-minute record of the user's heart-rate.
